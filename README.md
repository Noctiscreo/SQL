# SQL
A sample SQL assignment completed on a bootcamp.

This SQL was created from scratch but with some dummie data entries being input using an online tool.
(the website ended up being almost more trouble than it was worth, as the dummie data didn't quite work with the
assignment requirements). The SQL instructor said this would be looked into for future courses.

I have also included Entity_Diagram.jpg which shows a screenshot of the planning stage for the database. We used Visual Paradigm.

Please see 'Portfolio_2-John_Hasznosi.docx' in the GitHub repo for a more full explanation of this assignment.

Finally, I have included my portfolio feedback in the pdf 'John_Hasznosi-Feedback.pdf'.
